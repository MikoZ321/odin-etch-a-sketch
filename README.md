# odin-etch-a-sketch

An imitation of a classic toy, also the fourth project in TOP fundamentals.

During this project I had to use the following skills:

-using HTML attributes including creating my own through data-

-furthering my confidence with CSS and the cascading aspect of it

-using JS to create DOM elements

-writing clean code by spliting it up into functions and using guard clauses

-utilising the Math library

-creating and using event listeners

-manipulating attributes and CSS with JS
